# Logseq Slavsko Theme

A Logseq theme with bold typography. I decided to name it after a skiing resort town in Ukraine because the titles are bold like mountains. Most of the code I got from the [miA theme](https://github.com/playerofgames/logseq-mia-theme). Huge kudos ðŸ’Œ to the theme creators. 
Also I am using the [Onest font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Onest) from Google Fonts, which looks beautifully with ukrainian cyrillic.

Better looking tables:

## Installation

The theme **is not** yet available on the Logseq marketplace. It's just a CSS file you copy to your Logseq Vault folder inside 'logseq' directory. The path should be like `/path-to-your-logseq/vault-name/logseq/custom.css`.
