# Logseq Slavsko Theme ‚õ∞Ô∏è

Minimal light [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) theme with bold typography and cyrillic font support. It's named after a skiing resort in Ukraine because the titles are bold like mountains.

## Features

### Better looking tables

### Bullet drill-down enhancement
When drilled down, the parent bullet has its bullet hidden, font size incerased, guideline removed, and various alignment tweaks to get it inline with the breadcrumb + child blocks.

### Hidden query builder

I've hidden the simple query builder so that with queries pages look cleaner. If you'd like it to stay, find and delete this piece:

```css
.cp__query-builder {
    display: none;
  }
```

## Installation

The theme **is not** yet available on the Logseq marketplace. It's just a CSS file you copy to your Logseq Vault folder inside 'logseq' directory. The path should be like `/path-to-your-logseq/vault-name/logseq/custom.css`. 

Alternatively you can search for a `custom.css` file from within your logseq like any other page and copy-paste the code from my [custom.css](custom.css) file.

Huge kudos to the theme creators üíõ
- I am using the [Onest font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Onest), which looks gorgeously with ukrainian cyrillic, and Roboto for tables.
