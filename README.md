# Logseq Slavsko Theme ‚õ∞Ô∏è

A Logseq theme with bold typography. I decided to name it after a skiing resort town in Ukraine because the titles are bold like mountains. Most of the code I got from the [miA theme](https://github.com/playerofgames/logseq-mia-theme). Huge kudos üíå to the theme creators. 
Also I am using the [Onest font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Onest) from Google Fonts, which looks beautifully with ukrainian cyrillic.

## Features
### Better looking tables

### Bullet-drill down enhancement
When drilled down, the parent bullet has its bullet hidden, font size incerased, guideline removed, and various alignment tweaks to get it inline with the breadcrumb + child blocks.

## Installation

The theme **is not** yet available on the Logseq marketplace. It's just a CSS file you copy to your Logseq Vault folder inside 'logseq' directory. The path should be like `/path-to-your-logseq/vault-name/logseq/custom.css`.
